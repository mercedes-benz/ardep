On the ARDEP mainboard, the pinout is configured as shown below.
CAN Channel B is permanently connected to the DB-9 connector.
CAN Channel A and LIN are permanently connected to the spring terminal block.
Using SW1, the user can choose to connect CAN-A or LIN to the DB-9 connector.

CAN
===

The ARDEP Mainboard comes with two CAN-FD capable CAN Transceivers.
each of which, is connected to a common mode choke, ESD protection as well as a hardware configurable 120-Ohm termination.

    CAN Interface rev. 0.2
    
In rev 0.1 the Termination was implemented to be software-configurable.
This feature has been removed starting from rev 0.2 due to cost and practicality reasons.

Pin-mapping
===========

CAN A
-----
CAN A is directly connected to the spring contact terminal and can be connected to the DB-9 connector with the help of SW1.
lToggling SW1 will disconnect LIN from Pin7 and connect CANA to pin 7 and 2

LIN
===

LIN is permanently connected to the spring contact terminal and can be connected to the DB-9 connector with the help of SW1.
Toggling SW1 will disconnect CAN-A from Pin 7 & 2 and instead connect LIN to Pin 7.

The User can select to Supply the LIN driver from the mainboard internal 5 V supply, or an external Supply connected to the spring contact terminal.
The LIN supply is specified for up to 24 V and is additionally connected to one of the 0.1‚Äù Header connectors.

Using a solid-state Relay The LIN Interface can be software-configured for master- or slave mode.
