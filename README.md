# The Automotive Rapid Development Platform (ARDEP)

This repository contains the Software and all Hardware design files
required for the Automotive Rapid DEvelopment Platform (ARDEP). ARDEP
is an open and flexible approach to implement the soft- and hardware
of new functionality for automotive and industrial projects quickly
and frictionlessly. ARDEP also provides a path to transform early
prototypes into volume produced hardware without any breaks in the
development path.

# Installation

TODO:

- Provide info for how to get the ARDEP board and getting started with it
- (?) make the ARDEP software work with arduino-due (with limited
  functionality)
