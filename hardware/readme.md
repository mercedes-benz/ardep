# Hardware Source files
This directory includes all hardware source files for the ARDEP Mainboard and auxilary shields.

## KiCad Conversion
The initial project development was started in Altium designer. After the Hardware release of the ARDEP Mainboard rev 2.1 and the Power IO shield rev 1.0 in December 2025, the Altium source files were converted to KiCad.

From this point on, the KiCad source files are considered as the active project documents while the Altium source files are treated as legacy data and will no longer be actively maintained.
