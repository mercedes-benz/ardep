\mainpage ARDEP API Documentation

The Automotive Rapid DEvelopment Platform (ARDEP) is based on the [Zephyr RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/).

If you can't find a specific API here, you will probably find it in [Zephyr's API documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.5.0/doxygen/html/index.html)
