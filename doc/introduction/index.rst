Welcome to the ARDEP project!

ARDEP is an acronym for **A**\ utomotive **R**\ apid **DE**\ velopment **P**\ latform.

ARDEP is a powerful toolkit specifically designed for automotive developers based on the `Zephyr RTOS <https://www.zephyrproject.org/>`_.
It provides easy to use abstractions, features and tools to simplify the development process for automotive applications.

Key Features
============
- Robust framework: The ARDEP provides a solid foundation for building automotive applications.
- Development board: The integrated development board allows you to quickly prototype and test your ideas, providing easy access to communication interfaces and GPIO's.
- Automotive-focused: The project is specifically tailored to the needs of automotive developers, ensuring compatibility with industry protocols.
- Versatile connectivity: The ARDEP supports various communication interfaces, including I2C, SPI, UART, CAN and LIN, enabling seamless integration with other automotive systems.
- Extensibility: The modular design of the ARDEP allows for easy expansion and customization, giving you the flexibility to adapt it to your specific project requirements.
- No need for external transceivers: Onboard CAN and LIN transceivers give you the output you really want.
